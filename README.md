#Smart Store for a Smart City

Our Project is based on automating the shopping experience of people providing them a self checkout facility through a Mobile Application and solving their queries through it.
For this the following methodology is followed :
1. Smart Cart :After entering the mall/store, the person picks up a Smart Cart that has a RFID Scanner and an automatic Glass fitted on the top.This glass cover is programmed in a way that it opens when a person scans the item(s) he wishes to purchase and once scanned it adds to the cart and the glass cover closes by itself. If an item with the same id is scanned an even number of times, it would signify that the person wants to remove the item from the cart and an odd number would signify that the person wants to buy the item. 
2. Bill Generation and Checkout :According to person's actions, His bill will be generated automatically and before checking out of store, person needs to end shopping via mobile application which would then automatically cut the amount equal to the bill generated from person's linked bank account, thus, avoiding the time wasted in long queues for billing currently at large stores. 
3. Payments : Payments can be done through 4 ways including Paytm, Phonepe, Paypal and GooglePay.
4. Chatbot for user guidance: The application will be supported by a chatbot to guide them in case of any issues, in order to provide a better customer experience.
